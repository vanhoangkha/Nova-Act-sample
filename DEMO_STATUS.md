## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue

### Act() Function Timeouts
The `nova.act()` function calls are timing out after 30-120 seconds. This indicates:

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Network Latency**: The Nova Act service might be experiencing delays
2. **API Rate Limiting**: The API key might have usage restrictions
3. **Service Availability**: The Nova Act backend service might be under load
4. **Regional Issues**: Network connectivity to Nova Act servers

**Evidence of Partial Success:**
- ‚úÖ Session creation works (we see session IDs like `87882f48-e335-4cd2-bed3-fbb406fc9ad6`)
- ‚úÖ Browser launches successfully
- ‚úÖ Pages load correctly
- ‚úÖ Log directories are created (`/tmp/tmp*_nova_act_logs/`)
- ‚è≥ Act calls start but don't complete within timeout

## üéØ Recommendations

### 1. Try Different Timeouts
```python
# Try with longer timeout
result = nova.act("search for laptop", timeout=300)  # 5 minutes
```

### 2. Try Simpler Actions
```python
# Try very simple actions first
result = nova.act("click")
```

### 3. Check Network Connectivity
```bash
# Test connectivity to Nova Act servers
curl -I https://nova.amazon.com/act
```

### 4. Try Different Times
- The service might be less loaded at different times
- Try running demos during off-peak hours

### 5. Contact Nova Act Support
- Email: nova-act@amazon.com
- Report the timeout issues with session IDs

## üìä Demo Files Ready to Use

All demo files are created and ready to run once the `act()` timeout issue is resolved:

1. `01_basic_ecommerce.py` - E-commerce automation
2. `02_information_extraction.py` - Data extraction with Pydantic
3. `03_parallel_processing.py` - Concurrent browser sessions
4. `04_authentication_demo.py` - Login and session management
5. `05_file_operations.py` - File upload/download
6. `06_form_filling.py` - Form automation
7. `07_search_filter.py` - Search and filtering
8. `08_real_estate.py` - Real estate analysis
9. `09_interactive_demo.py` - Interactive mode usage
10. `10_advanced_features.py` - Advanced features

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Wait and Retry**: Try running the demos again in a few hours
2. **Contact Support**: Report the timeout issue to Nova Act team
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check the log files in `/tmp/tmp*_nova_act_logs/` for more details
4. **Try Simple Actions**: Start with very basic actions to test connectivity

## üí° Working Commands

```bash
# Activate environment
cd /home/ubuntu/nova-act/demo_use_cases
source demo_env/bin/activate

# Set API key
export NOVA_ACT_API_KEY=f3d656b2-fb35-47e0-ba09-22505bc343dc

# Run basic test (this works)
python3 basic_test.py

# Try demos (may timeout on act() calls)
python3 working_demo.py
```

The infrastructure is completely set up and working - we just need the Nova Act service to respond to `act()` calls within reasonable timeouts.
