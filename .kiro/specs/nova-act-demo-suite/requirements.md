# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring and enhancing the Nova Act Demo Suite. The project aims to create a comprehensive, well-structured demonstration platform that showcases Nova Act's capabilities across 10 different scenarios, from basic e-commerce operations to advanced features with production-level integrations.

The refactored demo suite will provide clear examples for developers to understand Nova Act's functionality, serve as a testing framework for the library, and demonstrate best practices for web automation tasks.
