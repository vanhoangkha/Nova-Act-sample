# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical issues in the Nova Act Demo Suite. The current demo suite has several problems including authentication failures, missing error handling, website structure changes, and geographic access restrictions that prevent demos from running successfully.

The goal is to create a robust, reliable demo suite that handles errors gracefully and provides meaningful feedback to users when issues occur.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer running the Nova Act demos, I want proper error handling and fallback mechanisms, so that I can understand what went wrong when demos fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a demo encounters an authentication error THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance about API key requirements and geographic restrictions
2. WHEN a demo fails due to website changes THEN the system SHALL attempt alternative selectors or gracefully degrade functionality
3. WHEN a demo cannot complete an action THEN the system SHALL log the specific failure reason and continue with remaining steps where possible
4. WHEN all demos complete THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed summary of successes, failures, and recommendations
5. WHEN a demo fails THEN the system SHALL not crash the entire demo suite

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using Nova Act from outside the US, I want demos that work with my geographic location, so that I can evaluate the library's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run demos from outside the US THEN the system SHALL detect geographic restrictions and use alternative websites
2. WHEN Amazon access is restricted THEN the system SHALL use alternative e-commerce sites like eBay or local equivalents
3. WHEN certain features are unavailable THEN the system SHALL skip those specific tests and continue with available functionality
4. WHEN geographic issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear messaging about limitations and alternatives
5. WHEN possible THEN the system SHALL use region-agnostic websites for demonstrations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the demo suite, I want robust website element detection, so that demos continue working when websites update their layouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a demo looks for page elements THEN the system SHALL use multiple selector strategies (ID, class, text content, xpath)
2. WHEN primary selectors fail THEN the system SHALL attempt fallback selectors automatically
3. WHEN elements are not found THEN the system SHALL wait with exponential backoff before failing
4. WHEN page structure changes THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about what was expected vs found
5. WHEN critical elements are missing THEN the system SHALL provide actionable troubleshooting information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer running the demo suite, I want consistent logging and directory management, so that I can easily debug issues and review execution traces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN demos start THEN the system SHALL automatically create all required log directories
2. WHEN demos execute THEN the system SHALL log all actions, decisions, and errors with timestamps
3. WHEN demos complete THEN the system SHALL organize logs by demo type and execution timestamp
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots and page source for debugging
5. WHEN the demo suite finishes THEN the system SHALL provide a consolidated log summary with links to detailed traces

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating Nova Act, I want a configuration system that adapts to my environment, so that I can run demos successfully regardless of my location or setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I first run the demo suite THEN the system SHALL detect my environment and suggest optimal configuration
2. WHEN I configure the demo suite THEN the system SHALL save preferences for future runs
3. WHEN demos need different settings THEN the system SHALL allow per-demo configuration overrides
4. WHEN I run demos repeatedly THEN the system SHALL remember successful configurations and reuse them
5. WHEN configuration issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance to resolve them
